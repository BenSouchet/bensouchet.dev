After working on {{< link href="https://bensouchet.dev/project/fabpilot-live-path-rendering/" target="_blank" >}}Path Rendering{{</ link >}}, I joined the product development team and performed many tasks. I was able to increase my knowledge in several languages and technologies.

I also discovered the **Agile method** with SCRUM, I found this way of working quite interesting especially if we tweak it according to the needs and constraints of the team and product.

To talk a bit more about the tasks I've done, I've set up a Question/Answer platform based on Markdown parsing, a quick and easy way to write user-friendly documentation.

I worked on the contact page and form, with for example the need to check the validity of a phone number (we used {{< link href="https://github.com/google/libphonenumber" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" >}}libphonenumber{{</ link >}} from _Google_).

Another important task I've been working on is parameter management, it's something vital and must be done well for any website with a client area.

In addition to these important tasks I have worked on the resolution of 40 problems or bugs, I made a total of 610 commits in 5 months and participated in 71 tickets.

It was the first time I worked with a real production team with stakes and deadlines, the experience was super enriching.
