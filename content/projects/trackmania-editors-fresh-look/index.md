Since I had more experience with Trackmania's interfaces since I worked on the Mesh Modeler, and knowing the technical constraints, I had the opportunity to update the interface of several editors for the release of the new Trackmania game that was about to be released, named simply {{< link href="https://www.trackmania.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">}}Trackmania{{</ link >}}.

First of all, I worked on the Map Editor, the most important editor because it's the most used. So I had to update the interface without changing the way it worked.

I worked in collaboration with the person in charge of the development and maintenance of this editor to make sure I didn't make any mistakes (breaking things).

An important task I had to do for the editors is the creation of the new icons, in the end I made more than 200 unique icons, all handmade.

I was not involved in the same way with all the editors, for the Skin Painter I was only in charge of making a mock-up of the interface and giving feedback but I didn't work directly on the rework.
On the Replay Editor I only gave assets and advice.

On the other hand on the Script Editor I had to do the rework entirely and in a limited time because at the same time I had many other tasks.
