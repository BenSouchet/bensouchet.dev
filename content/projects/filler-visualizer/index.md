This visualizer program is a bonus project I did during my programming course, it represents a Filler game between two players (algorithms).

Filler is a game where two players compete on a board, taking turns to place a piece provided to them, thus earning points. Once a player cannot place his piece, he can no longer play.
It is not simply a question of arranging his pieces as efficiently as possible, but preventing his opponent from doing so!

For this program I created a complete visual identity with a logo, a specific font, a main color. I also selected several color pairs to represent players, for each square displayed I played on the brightness to create color variations.

I developed several features such as the ability to pause and resume the game, to go back or forward step by step and to change the color pair of the players.

I also made the size of the squares on the game board and the size of the program window adapt to the size of the board.
