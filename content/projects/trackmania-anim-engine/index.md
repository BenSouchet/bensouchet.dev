The animation engine was the last project I worked on at Ubisoft Nadeo, I was in charge of its development throughout 2020.

When I took this subject the foundations of the engine were present but there wasn't much.

So I worked actively in collaboration with the technical animator to get a usable engine that meets our needs with robust features.

I can't talk about the technologies developed knowing that all this work is the exclusive property of Ubisoft Nadeo, I can simply say that the engine is based on the concept of Node Graph feeds with physic inputs and animation poses created by animators.

The main objective, which must be respected throughout the animation pipeline, is modularity so that a maximum number of cases can be easily managed.
