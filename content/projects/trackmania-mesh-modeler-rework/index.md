When I arrived at Ubisoft Nadeo, the first thing I interacted with and worked on was the Mesh Modeler.

The Mesh Modeler is an advanced tool, available to players, giving them the ability to create meshes directly in the game that they will be able to use later on their tracks.

The main problem with this editor is its accessibility, it's very difficult to do simple things, it's due to several elements but the main one, when I started working on it, was clearly the interface.

After several months working on the code I took the opportunity to redesign its interface, a work on the user interface (UI) but also on the user experience (UX).

It wasn't the first time that I was doing UI and UX (look at {{< link href="/project/raytracer/" target="_blank" >}}this project{{</ link >}} for example), although I don't have any formation I have a rather strong sensibility in this field, it's a subject that interests me and holds my attention in the websites, applications or games that I use.

I did this job in 1 month and in parallel with the current tasks, one element that made it possible for me to realize this complete rework quite quickly is the fact that I did everything myself, the research (mockups & prototypes) and the realization (graphic elements, icons and code).

I learned a lot working on this interface, advanced sprite management, image atlases, working with many constraints.
I have to admit that when this new interface was deployed in production and was available for players I was quite happy.
