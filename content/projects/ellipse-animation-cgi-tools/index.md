In 2021, I worked at **Ellipse Animation** (a production studio of **Dargaud / Media Participations**) as Technical Director to work on the production pipeline. I developed and maintained multiple tools over the 6 months of my contract, I worked mainly in _Python_ on **Maya** with the different Maya APIs (_Maya API, PyMel, OpenMaya_).

Lots of the work I have done isn't visual since it was _Python_ modules and packages to automate some long and complicated tasks, scripts for artists.

I made the automation module to create and prepare the Maya scenes for the animators (import of the models, putting the correct settings, disabling / reseting some attributes, ...).

I also create widgets, the main one being the **Ellipse Toolkit**, a widget displaying information about the current scene and providing buttons to launch the tools and edit the settings required by the multiple departments.
I put different colors on the buttons to easily find them even if the interface is re-arranged in the future.

Another Maya widget I made is the "Save Reminder". It's an element added to the interface that remind you easily if it's time to save your work, see the image below that show you the different stages of the widget.

To conclude, these 6 months were very nice, it had been a while since I had worked on **Autodesk Maya**, I was able to strongly improve my level in _Python_ (knowing _C++_ helped), overall a good experience.
